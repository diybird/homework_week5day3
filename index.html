            <h2>Introducing California's Greatest Cliffs</h2>
            <h3>What is so unique about California cliffs?</h3>
            <p>California cliffs are one of a kind in the United States where no cliffs are as magnificent and beautiful as them. And California is the only state that has cliffs that fronts all possible environments: sea, river, mountains, and canyons. There are four such individual unique cliffs: West Cliff, North Cliff, East Cliff, and South Cliff. All offer fantastic overlooking views, recreational areas, camping sites, wildlife watch spots, and overnight cabins.</p>
            <h3>Where are these cliffs?</h3>
            <p>Located within a 100-mile radius from Irvine, California, they can be reached by roads easily. The closest cliff to Irvine is West Cliff, which is the most popular and most visited.</p>
